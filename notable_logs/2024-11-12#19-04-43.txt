19:18:29.545 You are traveling a narrow dirt road through the gloomy Ulrich Forest. The
19:18:29.545 trees cast long shadows across the road and you hear the occasional rustle
19:18:29.545 in the undergrowth that lines its borders, as of something departing in
19:18:29.545 haste at your presence. The road continues to the north and south.
19:18:29.545 The sky is rainy and a cold northern gust blows.
